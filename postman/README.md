# FDK Postman Collections

You can find two collections one for **Application Side APIs** and other for **Platform Side APIs** which can be imported in Postman and used.

You will need to use **Import from Link** option and use the below links

1. Platform Front APIs Collection Link
```md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gofynd/fdk-client-apispec/v1.8.4-prerelease-v1/postman/platform.json
```

2. Application Front APIs Collection Link
```md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gofynd/fdk-client-apispec/v1.8.4-prerelease-v1/postman/application.json
```

After importing, you can use Collection Variables to change environment and configuration. More about using Collection Variables at [Postman's Documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#defining-collection-variables).

Minimum Postman Version Supported: v8.8.0
